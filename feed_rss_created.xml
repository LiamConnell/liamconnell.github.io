In some circles, RAG has become synonymous with LLM-based applications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think this is a mistake, and I believe that many of the most valuable use cases that leverage LLM technology will do so without anything that resembles RAG. &lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://liamconnell.github.io/blog/2024/06/12/5-archetypes-of-knowledge-intensive-applications/</link> <pubDate>Wed, 12 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://liamconnell.github.io/feed_rss_created.xml">Liam Connell's Blog</source><guid isPermaLink="true">https://liamconnell.github.io/blog/2024/06/12/5-archetypes-of-knowledge-intensive-applications/</guid> </item> <item> <title>A tour through tensorflow with financial data</title> <description>&lt;h1&gt;A tour through tensorflow with financial data&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I present several models ranging in complexity from simple regression to LSTM and policy networks. The series can be used as an educational resource for tensorflow or deep learning, a reference aid, or a source of ideas on how to apply deep learning techniques to problems that are outside of the usual deep learning fields (vision, natural language).&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://liamconnell.github.io/blog/2016/07/18/a-tour-through-tensorflow-with-financial-data/</link> <pubDate>Mon, 18 Jul 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://liamconnell.github.io/feed_rss_created.xml">Liam Connell's Blog</source><guid isPermaLink="true">https://liamconnell.github.io/blog/2016/07/18/a-tour-through-tensorflow-with-financial-data/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Deep Learning Reading List</title> <description>&lt;h1&gt;Deep Learning Reading List&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a lot written online about deep learning and AI. Ignoring the fluff and product-hype articles, you’re left with a huge resource for learning the technical side of the field. I won’t claim to have read everything out there, but here are some of the most useful things that I have found. The purpose of this list is not to be a definitive curriculum, but to recommend some of the high-quality educational material that’s out there. If there is an article that you think belongs on this list send me an &lt;a href=&#34;ljrconnell@gmail.com&#34;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://liamconnell.github.io/blog/2016/07/08/deep-learning-reading-list/</link> <pubDate>Fri, 08 Jul 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://liamconnell.github.io/feed_rss_created.xml">Liam Connell's Blog</source><guid isPermaLink="true">https://liamconnell.github.io/blog/2016/07/08/deep-learning-reading-list/</guid> </item> </channel></rss>
