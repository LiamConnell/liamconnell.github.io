# GenAI RAG Application Development

## Objective
Ground an LLM agent in real-world data using the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) architecture pattern. 

## Description
RAG applications come in many forms, from citation-enhanced chatbots to complex research assistants. They can be productivity tools for knowledge workers, business intelligence tools for decision makers, or product offerings for customers. 

Building on a strong foundation of ML application development, we've mastered the art of applying new LLM technology to knowledge-intensive applications. We are among the few who have gone beyond proof of concept technical demos, and learned the hard-won lessons that come from deploying these systems at scale. As we've learned, GenAI products become truly valuable when they reach a threshold of reliability. Building a reliable application out of unreliable components is our specialty. 

## Engagement Details

### Key Activities

* **Discovery**: We'll work with you to assess data sources, define the application requirements, and align on solution architecture and design.
* **Implementation**: We'll rapidly develop and deploy an application, and continue to iteratively improve based on performance and feedback.
* **Enablement**: With comprehensive documentation and operational guides, we'll hand over the system ownership to your team, enabling them to operate and extend it.

### Deliverables

* Full stack GenAI application and source code
* Performance evaluation system for confidently estimating the reliability of the system
* Operational documentation and handover

### Highlights

* Cloud agnostic
* LLM provider agnostic
