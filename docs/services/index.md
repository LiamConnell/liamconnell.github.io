# Consulting Services - Applied Machine Learning and AI

I help companies apply AI and ML technology to their most pressing business problems. With a decade of experience as a machine learning engineer, I bring deep expertise and a commitment to high standards that ensures project success.

My experience at a successful SaaS startup and a top consulting firm has given me a unique blend of technical and business skills. I pride myself on my ability to engage deeply on both sides of the equation, and this focus has won me a proven track record of addressing complex challenges for clients.
