# Hi, I'm Liam 

I'm a machine learning engineer with a decade of experience. I've worked at a successful startup and a top consulting firm, and now I work as an independent consultant helping companies apply the latest in machine learning and AI to their businesses.

# About me

Liam brings over a decade of expertise in machine learning and software engineering, with a proven track record of addressing complex challenges for clients. He excels in multiple roles, from a hands-on developer to a strategic partner, making him an invaluable asset to any project requiring technical excellence and forward-thinking leadership. As a developer and technical leader, he has successfully developed scalable machine learning applications and defined the operational model of data science teams in new modeling domains. He has also engaged with industry leaders to construct strategic GenAI roadmaps, reflecting his comprehensive approach across various sectors.

## Technical Expertise

### GenAI Application Development (AI Engineering)

“AI Engineering” is a term being used for the new domain around applying LLMs (open source / from providers) to develop the new application types that the technology unlocks - knowledge systems, content generation, workflow automation, semantic parsing and querying, and others.

BCG invested an enormous amount of capacity in 2023 in order to get its staff and leadership hands-on experience in this area. I had the opportunity to develop demos and lead the development of several applications:

* Consumer-facing knowledge assistant product at a global B2B information services provider
* GenAI-enabled network incident trend detection for a large telecommunications company
* Agricultural industry strategic knowledge assistant
* Natural language geospatial query generation and visualization application for agronomists

### Machine Learning Application Development
Most of my career has been around the development of data-intensive applications that leverage Machine Learning. I have deep experience in ML modeling techniques as well as the practical details of ML pipelines and the deployment of these systems to cloud services for scalability and effective hosting.

Some examples of projects in this area:
* Application and computer vision pipeline for leading insurance company to automate estimations of coverage in force (i.e., potential liabilities)
* Crop yield forecast for US corn and soy that beat the USDA in a historical backtest and live during the 2023 growing season
* Designed and trained a Reinforcement Learning agent to optimize machine operations at a food processing plant, using model-based and model-free RNN-based architecture.

### Geospatial Data Science
As the founding tech lead of BCG’s Center for Earth Intelligence, I had the opportunity to gain deep expertise in the field of geospatial data science. Using a scalable tech stack in python in order to achieve the highest modeling expressibility, we applied advanced ML and computer vision techniques to petabyte-scale data across continents. We took on use cases in insurance assessments, climate risk modeling, agronomy, B2B agriculture sales, and supply chain simulation.

### Technical Strategy for AI and ML
At BCG, I had several opportunities to leverage my deep practical technical expertise in an advisory role. My communication and critical thinking skills gave me a natural aptitude for this type of work and I found it highly stimulating. Some examples:
* Facilitated tech workshops with C-suite technologists across industries to define 2-year GenAI roadmaps.
* Conducted technical audits and strategic reviews of tech startups.
* Defined operating model for team of 8 experts to deliver value in new domain (geospatial DS).
* Enabled the development of a cross-functional data science team at a consumer goods company by defining roles and guiding re-skilling efforts.
* Weighed in on the feasibility of unproven use cases in GenAI and ML.
